# Story 6.1: Reception booking creation and editing

Status: done

> **Org-scoped, "Bookings"/"Guests"/"Payments" areas; all money via the Epic 5
> ledger.** Includes the epic-wide ledger sign-convention fix: refund entries are
> POSITIVE (money returned raises the open balance); adjustments may be either
> sign; receipts list payments only.

## What landed

deskBookings.create: existing guest or inline profile, room+dates (availability re-checked in-tx), source (walk_in/phone/direct/ota/agent/whatsapp), enabled-method check, confirmed status, BK- reference, stay charge posted to the ledger; updateNotes + confirm (pending website bookings). All audited. New-booking tab + per-booking Actions on /front-desk (FR18, FR16, NFR13, FR17).

## Verification

Backend 68/68 (8 new in deskBookings.test.ts — lifecycle incl. ID gate, balance
gate + exception, damage charge in the final balance, housekeeping trigger,
exact extension pricing, extension conflicts, same-type room change, cancel
waiver, refund sign, no-show, calendar spans + cap, permission gating). Web
65/65 incl. front-desk gating. Full turbo gate 14/14; production build OK.
