# Story 6.6: Check-out asset verification and housekeeping trigger

Status: done

> **Org-scoped, "Bookings"/"Guests"/"Payments" areas; all money via the Epic 5
> ledger.** Includes the epic-wide ledger sign-convention fix: refund entries are
> POSITIVE (money returned raises the open balance); adjustments may be either
> sign; receipts list payments only.

## What landed

checkOut assetCheck: discrepancies recorded; damage posts a positive ledger adjustment (lands in the final balance gate); room -> dirty; housekeepingTasks row created (pending/normal) — full housekeeping workspace is R2 (FR22; ties FR29, FR27).

## Verification

Backend 68/68 (8 new in deskBookings.test.ts — lifecycle incl. ID gate, balance
gate + exception, damage charge in the final balance, housekeeping trigger,
exact extension pricing, extension conflicts, same-type room change, cancel
waiver, refund sign, no-show, calendar spans + cap, permission gating). Web
65/65 incl. front-desk gating. Full turbo gate 14/14; production build OK.
